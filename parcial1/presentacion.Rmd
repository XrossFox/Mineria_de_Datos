## Problem description

When we buy a processor, we usually rely on the processing speed that the manufacturer indicated as valid.

But, is there any way to know which vendors are loyal to their customers and actually deliver them an expected processing speed?

We used a dataset thath help to answer the question.

##Boxplots of the data
A boxplot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles.
```{r plotbox}
#Boxplot of machine cycle time
boxplot(cpuData$MYCT,
        main = "Boxplot of Machine cycle time",
        ylab = "Nanosenconds (Ns.)") 

#Boxplot of the minimum main memory
boxplot(cpuData$MMIN,
        main = "Boxplot of Minimum main memory",
        ylab = "Kilobytes (Kb.)")

#Boxplot of the maximum main memory
boxplot(cpuData$MMAX,
        main = "Boxplot of Maximum main memory",
        ylab = "Kilobytes (Kb.)") 

#boxplot of the cache memory
boxplot(cpuData$CACH,
        main = "Boxplot of cache memory",
        ylab = "Kilobytes (Kb.)") 

#boxplot of the maximum main memory
boxplot(cpuData$MMAX,
        main = "Boxplot of Maximum main memory",
        ylab = "Kilobytes (Kb.)")

#boxplot of the minimum channels
boxplot(cpuData$CHMIN,
        main = "Boxplot of Minimum channels",
        ylab = "Units (U.)")

#boxplot of the maximum channels
boxplot(cpuData$CHMAX,
        main = "Boxplot of Maximum channels",
        ylab = "Units (U.)")

#boxploot of the relative performance
boxplot(cpuData$PRP,
        main = "Boxplot of published relative performance",
        ylab = "Performance (P.)") 

#boxplot of the estimated relative performance from original article
boxplot(cpuData$MMAX,
        main = "Boxplot of estimated relative performance from original article",
        ylab = "Performance (P.)") 
```
